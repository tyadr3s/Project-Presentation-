Slide 2 – What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing delivers computing services such as servers, storage, databases, and software through the internet.
 It allows people to access data and applications from anywhere, at any time.
 The main providers are Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.
 During the pandemic, it became essential as most workplaces moved online and needed reliable access to their systems remotely.
